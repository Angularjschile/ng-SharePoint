ng-SharePoint
=============

AngularJS ng-SharePoint wraps SharePoint JSOM into Angular world

A set of services, directives and utilities that allows you to access and interact with SharePoint sites, lists and items.

I like to work with:
* Promises (no global callback functions)
* Directives (easy functional HTML)
* Templates (no javascript concatenation of strings and results)
* Services (encasulate JSOM and REST calls)
* Other cool frameworks from the community (angular-ui, ionic, ...)

Current Status
--------------
Currently this is a beta version that has only been used in internal projects. I will continue posting improvements and more features in future releases.
